The inaugural 'first post'; literally nothing much to see untill some actual content is pushed in.

One of my favorate technical people has this saying:

That is what this site is about ... well that and that I freely admit to being lazy; just ask yourself how many times have you googled the __same damned thing__ you did some time ago having to re click-through all of the random pages in order to groc (hopefully) most of the context you got last time in order to move on with a piece of work.

So out of mostly lazyness here we are; a randm repository of thoughts; links and _next great million dollar ideas_ if only to save myself of a few extra keypresses over the course of my lifetime.

The site has been built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) the static site generator; and hosted over in the [shiggan/mad.geek.nz](https://github.com/shiggan/mad.geek.nz) github project; and served up via github pages.

If you head over there the interesting stuff is all in the `source` branch; when hugo does a publish it does so into a known directory which has some git magic sprinkled into it so that it points to the `master` branch which is what github pages actually serves on the site.

Pages are written in [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) format; whcih hugo uses to build up the site you see now.

As for the awesome design of the site; that is taken form the `hugo-future-imperfect-slim` hugo template available over at [https://github.com/pacollins/hugo-future-imperfect-slim](https://github.com/pacollins/hugo-future-imperfect-slim).
