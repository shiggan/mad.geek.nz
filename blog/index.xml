      <description>This will be the first post in a short series about getting started with hugo. By the end of this you will have a dead simple proof of concept site which we will build on in later posts.
Static site generators such as Hugo are great for sites that donâ€™t have any particular reason for dynamic (database driven) content; or for simple sites where the &amp;lsquo;dynamic&amp;rsquo; content you do have rarely changes.</description>

      <description>The inaugural &amp;lsquo;first post&amp;rsquo;; literally nothing much to see untill some actual content is pushed in.
One of my favorate technical people has this saying:
 There are a finite number of keystrokes left in your hands before you die. - @shanselman
 That is what this site is about &amp;hellip; well that and that I freely admit to being lazy; just ask yourself how many times have you googled the same damned thing you did some time ago having to re click-through all of the random pages in order to groc (hopefully) most of the context you got last time in order to move on with a piece of work.</description>
